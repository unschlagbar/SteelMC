//! Block entity system for blocks that need additional data storage.
//!
//! Block entities provide additional data storage and functionality for blocks
//! that need more than what block state properties can offer (e.g., chests,
//! furnaces, signs, etc.).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Similar to the block/item behavior system, block entities use a registry
//! pattern:
//! - `BlockEntityRegistry` - maps `BlockEntityType` to factory functions
//! - `BlockEntityStorage` - stores block entities in a chunk
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use steel_core::block_entity::{init_block_entities, BLOCK_ENTITIES};
//!
//! // After registry is frozen, call once at startup:
//! init_block_entities();
//!
//! // Create a block entity:
//! let entity = BLOCK_ENTITIES.create(block_entity_type, pos, state);
//! ```
